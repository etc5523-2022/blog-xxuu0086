## Introduction 

Coffee is one of necessary in our everyday life. In every part of the world, in every culture, people drink coffee.
Coffee is ubiquitous in modern society, it plays an vital role in our daily life; it gives people a good start of a day, providing energy to people throughout the work and study, inspiring people' mind and also enriching people' spare time.

The history of coffee can be traced hundreds of years ago, and it is becoming a common refreshment drink spreading around the world. Some people with industrious minds recognizes this widespread appeal, and the more of the entrepreneurs uses the opportunity to make coffee a commodity and selling around the world so that they could profit from. Today, we can see coffee chain coffeehouses in every corner of the world, this are the fruits of coffee entrepreneurs' hard work and labor in the numerous coffee chains that have taken root worldwide. There are countless of coffee chains around the world, this post will only analyse three of main coffee chains in the world, which are Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts. The main focus of this post will be Starbucks and using Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts as supplementary to the analysis. We will take a close look at the coffee chain data in this post, especially the Starbucks and aim to see the distribution of coffee stores.



## Data Description

The data is stored in a XLSX file and contains three set of coffee chain data, which corresponding to Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts respectively. __Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts__, which are the three of main coffee chains in the world. The variables in each of coffee chain data set can be categorized into two groups; __the business store detail__ (store name, store number and store phone number etc) and __the geographical location information__ for each of coffeehouse (i.e. address, postcode, city, country, longitude and latitude etc). 

The Starbucks data set contains __`r nrow(coffee)`__ observations and __`r ncol(coffee)`__ variables, and it has included the Starbucks coffeehouses in __`r length(unique(coffee$Country))`__ countries. The Tim Hortons data set contains __`r nrow(coffee2)`__ observations and __`r ncol(coffee2)`__ variables, and it contains only __`r length(unique(coffee2$country))`__ countries' coffeehouses data, which are USA and Canada. Similarly, the Dunkin' Donuts data set contains __`r nrow(coffee3)`__ observations and __`r ncol(coffee3)`__ variables, and it contains only __`r length(unique(coffee3$e_country))`__ country' coffeehouses data, which is __`r unique(coffee3$e_country)`__.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#| tbl-cap: _Dimension Table of the three coffee chainnn_
a <- data.frame("Dimension" = c("No. Observation", "No. Varable", "No. Country"), "Starbucks" = c(dim(coffee), length(unique(coffee$Country))), "Tim Hortons" = c(dim(coffee2),length(unique(coffee2$country))), "Dunkin' Donuts" = c(dim(coffee3), length(unique(coffee3$e_country))))
a %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_classic()
```

From the data dimension table, it shows the Starbucks data set contains more observation of its coffeehouses and more worldwide compared with other two coffee chains Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts, where the data are limited to one or two countries. In this post, we will be more focused on the Starbucks coffee chain due to the limitation of the data of the other two coffee chain, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts.
