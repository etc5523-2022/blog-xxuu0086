There are countless of coffee chains around the world, this post will only analyse three of main coffee chains in the world, which are Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts. The main focus of this post will be Starbucks and using Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts as supplementary to the analysis. We will take a close look at the coffee chain data in this post, especially the Starbucks and aim to see the distribution of coffee stores.\n\n\n\n## Data Description\n\nThe data is stored in a XLSX file and contains three set of coffee chain data, which corresponding to Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts respectively. __Starbucks, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts__, which are the three of main coffee chains in the world. The variables in each of coffee chain data set can be categorized into two groups; __the business store detail__ (store name, store number and store phone number etc) and __the geographical location information__ for each of coffeehouse (i.e. address, postcode, city, country, longitude and latitude etc). \n\nThe Starbucks data set contains __25600__ observations and __13__ variables, and it has included the Starbucks coffeehouses in __73__ countries. The Tim Hortons data set contains __4955__ observations and __6__ variables, and it contains only __2__ countries' coffeehouses data, which are USA and Canada. Similarly, the Dunkin' Donuts data set contains __4898__ observations and __22__ variables, and it contains only __1__ country' coffeehouses data, which is __USA__.\n\n\n::: {.cell tbl-cap='_Dimension Table of the three coffee chainnn_'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-classic\" style='font-family: \"Arial Narrow\", \"Source Sans Pro\", sans-serif; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;'>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dimension </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Starbucks </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Tim.Hortons </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Dunkin..Donuts </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No. Observation </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 25600 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4955 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 4898 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No. Varable </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 22 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> No. Country </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 73 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the data dimension table, it shows the Starbucks data set contains more observation of its coffeehouses and more worldwide compared with other two coffee chains Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts, where the data are limited to one or two countries. In this post, we will be more focused on the Starbucks coffee chain due to the limitation of the data of the other two coffee chain, Tim Hortons and Dunkin' Donuts. \n\nThe data source is from Tidy Tuesday (Thomas Mock) [https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-05-07](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-05-07) .\n\n## Reference\n\nThomas Mock (2022).
